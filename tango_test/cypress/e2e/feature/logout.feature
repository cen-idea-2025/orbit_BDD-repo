Feature:Testing Login functionality of a web application - Logout

    As a user
    I want to test the login functionality of a web application
    So that I can ensure that the application is secure and functional.


Scenario: Testing for successful logout
Given I am logged into the app
When I logout
Then I should be logged out successfully
